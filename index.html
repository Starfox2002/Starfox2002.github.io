                    <p>Hi, I'm Simon and I am a second year student at Simon Fraser University. I was born and live in Vancouver for my entire life.
                        Previously, I was a student at Langara College, but transferred over to complete a full 4 year Bachelor's. Computer science is a fascinating
                        topic for me because currently, it's making a big impact on the world and I would like to be a part of those who will make a difference for mankind.
